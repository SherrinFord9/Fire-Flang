# Fire-Flang

Solution to prevent the happening of wildfires (Not only natural but also man made) across the world .

Problem Statement   -  Prediction and prevention of a wildfire 
Solution - This model would be collecting 4 main basic data :-

    1.Weather (Why - To predict the movement of the wind and the weather forcast
                Data - Getting data for weather would not be herculine task as all the meteorological weather stations have real time and live tracking of weather )

    2.Topography (Why - To predict the direction of the wildfire 
                 Data - NASA has free data provided online for data on topography)

    3.Prolysis of the flora and fauna (Why - To predict the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures
                                      Data - Getting data for prolysis is possible from the various research papers publish on diffent types of flora and fauna presnt in our enivironment )

    4.Human activity (Why - To give the priority level of the wildfire
                      Data - Human activities around the place , social networking sites and travel agencies )
                            
Deploying econimical and efficient heat sensors placing them streatigically across the forest , and connecting them via LoRaWAN to the AZURE server and prediciting possible places and timing of wildfire at a large scale.
